Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy&#8217;s basket and oiled the Woodman&#8217;s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-140 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/subsolardesigns.com\/odrin\/demo2\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2017\/08\/a68eb327263933.563623b6570d6-1-214x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" \/>&#8220;This will serve me a lesson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to look where I step.

The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You people with hearts,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful.
